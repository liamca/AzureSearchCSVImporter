# Azure Search CSV Data Importer
This is a tool for importing CSV data to an Azure Search index.  It is still under development so if there are issues you find with your dataset, please let me know (twitter @liamca).

This tool assumes you already have an Azure Search service.  To learn how to do this, please visit the [MSDN documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/).
